# Docker + Kubernetes + GitOps Dev Lab

A learning / demo project combining infrastructure-as-code, containerization, and GitOps principles — using Docker, Kubernetes, and GitOps tooling (FluxCD).

## 📚 What this project is

This repository serves as a sandbox / lab for:

- Provisioning infrastructure (possibly via scripts / IaC tools)  
- Building Dockerized applications  
- Deploying and managing workloads on Kubernetes  
- Using GitOps: store cluster config in Git, auto-apply via Flux
- Practicing CI/CD, infra versioning, and reproducible deployments
